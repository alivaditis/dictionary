## Abstract: 
A dictionary app built using Figma design specs and design system provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL) and the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)

A website for sci-fi readers that uses the fetch API to get information from the [Google Books Api](https://developers.google.com/books) and render that data. Users can search for sci-fi books, view information for a specific book, and save them to a 'want to read', 'currently reading', or 'read' shelf. Additionally uses can browse curated lists, which are accessed through the bookshelves enpoint of the Google Books Api. The app uses network requests to access information about sci-fi books, utilizes react router to create a multi-page experience, handles user authentication and data with firebase auth/database, and is e2e tested using Cypress.
